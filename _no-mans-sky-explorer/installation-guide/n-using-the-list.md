# Using The List

## Starting The List

Open Mod Organizer.exe and launch `No Man's Sky - Explorer Launcher` through the executables. It should be already automatically selected. This is a custom executable of NMS.exe. There will be a warning message when launching the game concerning mods. Simply click to skip to the main menu. **THIS IS NORMAL DON'T PANIC!** 

{: .note } You can create a desktop shortcut in the shortcuts dropdown.

{: .warning }
> Do not launch the game through Steam or GOG. This will launch vanilla No Man's Sky.

{: .warning }
> You shall add the list to your antivirus exceptions list as it will potentially stop it from interfering.

## Do Not Click unlock!

Mod Organizer locks your mods, load order, and other executables while running an executable. This is to prevent the user from making changes while the game is running. Clicking unlock may corrupt your game experience.
