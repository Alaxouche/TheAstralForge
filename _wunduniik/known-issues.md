# Known Issues

While you play the list, you might run into a few issues that can vary from a simple fun bug to CTDs. Let's remember that we heavily mod an instable and extremely bugged and unclean game. From such base, adding mods can lead to instability. I shared here a compilation of most of the known issues you can find when playing.

## Vanilla Game Issues

- Sometimes word walls don’t do anything when you walk up to them. Just leave the cell and come back.
- A Soul Divided - Sometimes gets stuck. You’ll have to either reload or complete the quest via console.
- Sometimes Varona is still alive in Reluctant Steward. You can kill her and progress the quest via console.
- Brawl dialogue sometimes doesn’t show up. Usually playing a bit then re-entering the area will fix it.

## Modlist Issues

- Missives sometimes bugs out with gathering quests. I recommend not picking them up.
- Vampires/werewolves bugs. Growl/Sacrilege is the best we got. Unless something is crashing, don’t report it.
- Night Eye. This is an ENB-specific issue. Some ENBs have fixed Nighteye, some don’t. Don’t report these.
- Lighting Crash: Game CAN CRASH when too many lights are on. Wearing too many lanterns, light backpacks, etc make this more common.
- Crash on loading/changing cells: This can sometimes happen randomly due to either DynDOLOD DLLs and Lux. Please only report if these are repeatable. You can minimize these by setting page file, updating drivers and getting pre-requisites per GitHub.
- Some NPCs you encounter might have neck seam or unmatching skin color.
- Crash on entering whiterun jarl quarters. The issue was not identified yet.

{: .warning}
> **CAUTION**
>
> The vanilla start not working or being massively bugged is not an actual issue. The vanilla scene itself is extremely scripted and bugged already. With mods, especially other script or behavioral mods, it becomes unplayable. This is the reason why we use an alternate start mod. Please do not use the vanilla start and/or report a bug about it working, there is nothing to be done here.
