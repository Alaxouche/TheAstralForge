# Using The List

## Starting The List

Open Mod Organizer.exe and launch 'Wunduniik Launcher' through the executables. It should be already automatically selected. This is a custom executable of SKSE. As the modlist is quite big, depending on your pc, it may take some time to load the game. **THIS IS NORMAL DON'T PANIC!** 

{: .note } You can create a desktop shortcut in the shortcuts dropdown.

{: .warning }
> Do not launch the game through Steam. This will launch vanilla Skyrim.

{: .warning }
> You shall add the list to your antivirus exceptions list as it will potentially stop it from interfering.

## Do Not Click unlock!

Mod Organizer locks your mods, load order, and other executables while running an executable. This is to prevent the user from making changes while the game is running. Clicking unlock may corrupt your game experience.

## Configuring MCM

ALL MCM's have been pre-configured via Settings Loader mods, however you can change the settings if you don't like them.  
Settings Loader is an addon to the MCMs, that allows to automatically load the presets and changes i made at the launch of your game. Yet, BE CAREFUL! If you change the MCMs settings, there is no way to recover the ones i added! Make sure to remember what was by default before making any change to them!

{: .warning }
> Failure to wait for MCMs to finish can cause quite a few issues later on and will require you to start a new save.

## Keymapping

In order to help the player to understand and use a maximum of the list's functionalities, here is a keybind map of most of the used shortcuts ingame:

Consider that the keymap is also available directly in-game by using the F8 key. It will show a menu with fullscreen keymap. Click tab to close it.
