  <dt><strong>Q:</strong> How do i update my Wunduniik modlist?</dt>  
  <dd><strong>A:</strong> Updating Wunduniik looks almost the same, as your first time installing it.
If you did not clear previous download location, mods that did not change from last update, will use already downloaded files, which is making updating a lot faster than fresh install.
Keep in mind, that after update, all mods added by you, will be deleted. If you want to keep mods, added by yourself, add [NoDelete] at the beginning of mod name.
Download our file from Nexus site or from Wabbajack Application and extract it.
Open Wabbajack installer and point it to your "Wunduniik.wabbajack" file location.
Remember to mark "Overwrite location".
Click "Start" button.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q:</strong> How do I activate the NSFW options ?</dt>  
  <dd><strong>A:</strong> Wunduniik does not make use of NSFW anymore. Yet, we provide as an optional mod an additional bodyslide folder containing nude bodies. You can find and enable it in the optional mods separator.</dd>

  <dt><strong>Q:</strong> How do I add Widescreen support?</dt>
  <dd><strong>A:</strong> Those are automatically activated as the mod manager auto detects your screen ratio. No need to worry about it anymore.</dd>
  
  <dt><strong>Q:</strong> I don't like the current character preset and I can't find how to change it, help!</dt>
  <dd><strong>A:</strong> Do not panic. Wunduniik is making use of Obody, which allows you to use a ton of different body presets from a list. To change your bodymorph, press "o" and the menu will appear. You only have to click on one of the preset and poof! Your body is now swapped.</dd>

## Reporting an Issue

If, during your playthrough, you encounter any bug, incompatibility, that may disturb your gameplay/immersion, I invite you to head over my discord server and to share the bug you found in the dedicated channel, so I can try to fix it for a future update. We are working together to make this modlist always better!

### Share your crash log

If you crash using latest version of Wunduniik and want to report it, here is where you can find the newest generated crash log.

__Crash Log Location:__
Documents/My Games/Skyrim Special Edition/SKSE/crash-202x-xx-xx-xx-xx-xx.log

## INI Configuration

It is also possible that some of your INI settings are really unoptimized and may take some performances for nothing. Open BethINI and make sure the settings are like this:
- Shadow Resolution: 2048
- Ambient Occlusion: Either use this or the ENB version. The ENB version is more intensive. Do not have both turned on.
- Remove Shadows: I really donâ€™t recommend turning this on, but if you must then you can.

## Mods Configuration

As I already said it, the modlist is exclusively in 2K. This means that every file, including effects such as mists, dandelion seeds, ripples... are in 2K. You can lower them, as well as some clutter retextures, in 1K if you estimate that 2K is not necessary. You may not find a big difference between 1K and 2K for those files. Also, you can change some settings in the Fomods.  
It is possible that you might not like some of the items in the list and wish to change them to your personal preferences. To make this easier, I have added some special tags to indicate what they are:
- Basic Fomod: Regular fomod with only add-ons and other options. No patches for other mods.
- Patches Fomod: Self-explanatory and may contain add-ons and other options.
- Unpublished: Again, self-explanatory.
- Output: These are files I have generated for the list. You can and should regenerate them if you change something that affects them.

### Saving You Mod Changes

Before updating, ensure you rename any mods you have added by adding the prefix [NoDelete] to the mod. These are found on the left side of MO2 under the Mod Name column.  
This does not save your modded load order! All mods that were tagged with [NoDelete] will need their plugins to be manually placed back into the correct load order.  
You can copy the loadorder.txt document from your profiles folder within the Wunduniik installation to save a copy of the load order. Make sure the copy is saved outside of Wunduniik so it is not deleted in the update.
