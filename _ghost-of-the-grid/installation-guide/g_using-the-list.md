# Using The List

## Starting The List

Open Mod Organizer.exe and launch `Ghost of the Grid Launcher` through the executables. It should be already automatically selected. This is a custom executable of cyberpunk.exe with custom arguments to skip intro and redmod deployment. As the modlist is quite big, depending on your pc, it may take some time to load the game. **THIS IS NORMAL DON'T PANIC!** 

{: .note } You can create a desktop shortcut in the shortcuts dropdown.

{: .warning }
> Do not launch the game through Steam or GOG. This will launch vanilla Cyberpunk 2077.

{: .warning }
> You shall add the list to your antivirus exceptions list as it will potentially stop it from interfering.

## Do Not Click unlock!

Mod Organizer locks your mods, load order, and other executables while running an executable. This is to prevent the user from making changes while the game is running. Clicking unlock may corrupt your game experience.

## Switching Profiles

This modlist comes with two experiences:
- Ghost of the Grid - Performance: No custom traffic vehicles, no high resolution faces and NPCs, no improved LODs and lighter vanilla game settings (crowd density, overall visuals) but the rest of the list experience is unchanged.
- Ghost of the Grid - Standard: Base experience with high quality visuals but medium vanilla settings and mods settings to balance performance and visuals.
- Ghost of the Grid - Ultra: Base experience with high quality visuals and ultra vanilla settings and mods settings to provide the best visual experience.

Switch between them using the profile dropdown in the upper left of MO2.
