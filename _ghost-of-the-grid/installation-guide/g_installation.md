# Installation

## Pre-Installation

### RedMod

As the list uses mods made for RedMod, you need to ensure that you have it installed and working, else it might result in crashes. For steam users, you can download it [here](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060310/Cyberpunk_2077_REDmod/).

### Necessary Tweaks

Before installing the modlist, here are some things you must do:  
There is no workaround for a pirated copy of cyberpunk 2077, or pirated Phantom Liberty DLC. If you ask for support with anything pirated, you will be banned.

> **WARNING**

> If your Steam library is in Program Files, refer to this guide to move it elsewhere. Do not install do default Windows folders (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.) as this will cause issues.

In the Windows API (with some exceptions), the maximum length for a file path is 260 characters. For example, the maximum path on drive D is "D:\some 256-character path.

{: .note }
The list cannot be selected to install in the same folders that Wabbajack is in. They must be completely separated.

Here is an example of a well-configured game folder:
