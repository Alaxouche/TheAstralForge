# Known Issues

While you play the list, you might run into a few issues that can vary from a simple fun bug to CTDs. Let's remember that we heavily mod an instable and extremely bugged and unclean game. From such base, adding mods can lead to instability. I shared here a compilation of most of the known issues you can find when playing.

## Vanilla Game Issues

- Biker's might not load from distance when driving, leading to bikes without NPCs on them.

## Modlist Issues

- The list may CTD during the first act (Sandra Dorset recue). These crashes will disappear after the intro.
