## Join Our Discord Community

Engage with our community on [Alaxouche’s Modding Hub](https://discord.gg/alaxouche-s-modding-hub-750268919201398805) to receive personalized modding assistance, share screenshots, discuss creative lore, and stay informed on project developments. We host dedicated channels for the **Wunduniik** modlist—including support, bug reporting, and announcements—and conduct regular polls and planning discussions. Join us to collaborate directly with the Wunduniik Team and our broader community.

## About Us

The Astral Forge was established by Alaxouche in September 2020 as the official repository for the Wunduniik modlist. Since then, it has expanded and rebranded—first to Alaxouche’s Modding Hub and now to The Astral Forge—hosting four flagship modlists: **Wunduniik**, **Krentoraan**, **Ghost of the Grid**, and **Zuldolok**. We welcome submissions for additional modlists to increase visibility for authors and strengthen our collective credibility.

This site replaces the former WunduniikWiki.com, offering a modern, responsive design with theme switching, a streamlined interface, and up-to-date, clearly organized information.

## Getting Started

Our documentation provides comprehensive installation guides, changelogs, load orders, and known-issue reports essential for a seamless mod installation experience. Future updates will include detailed gameplay guides to enhance user experience. At present, the Wunduniik installation guide is fully implemented.
