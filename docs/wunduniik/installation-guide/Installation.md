## Pre-Installation

### Necessary Tweaks

Before installing the modlist, here are some things you must do:  
There is no workaround for a pirated copy of Skyrim, or pirated Creation Club content. If you ask for support with anything pirated, you will be banned.

> If your Steam library is in Program Files, refer to this guide to move it elsewhere. Do not install do default Windows folders (Desktop, Documents, Downloads, etc.) as this will cause issues.

The list cannot be selected to install in the same folders that Wabbajack is in. They must be completely separated.
